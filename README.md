[Make some emoji pasta 👨‍🍳](https://alexleybourne.github.io/emoji-data-pasta/)

I created this tool to easily edit this large [emoji.json](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data/blob/master/emoji.json) file to be smaller and customise some things for a react native emoji keyboard I have been working on. Just by stripping the fields to the ones you need using the minimal preset you can reduce the file size by `82.4%` (`1.2mb -> 224.6kb`)

By using the Data transform options and renaming fields to shorter names like `n` for `name` etc. you can get to under `100kb` 🤩

### Features include:
- Remove and rename data fields 🚮
- Emoji category merging, sorting and removal 🔀
- Bulk add and edit custom search terms 🔍
- Remove emojis from your data ❌
- The word pasta in the name 🍝
- Easily browse the emoji data 👀
- A pretty dark mode UI 🌚
- Smart data transforms to reduce file size 🗜️
- Load your current file to modify it 📝
- Export settings 💾

This was also a large vibe coding test with `calude-4-sonnet` so the code is more like Spaghetti rather than pasta 🍝

Base emoji data is from [iamcal/emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data/tree/master)
